# Storage

## S3 Storage

If you are already logged in, you can use the included S3 Storage to store image files. To do this, click on *Storage* (user role `user` or `creator` necessary).  

In the first section, you can upload image files. First select the respective file and then click *Upload*.  

There is even an easier way to upload images. By pressing ctrl-v (or your shortcut for paste) on that page the clipboard's content will be uploaded automatically.  
Note: This way the filename will be generated using the current timestamp. This is only working if the clipboard is containing image data!

In the second section, you can manage files that have already been uploaded.  

- The *eye* symbol displays that image in the browser
- The *download* symbol lets you download that image again
- The *trashcan* symbol deletes that image
- The *link* symbol copies the link to that image into your clipboard, so you can use it anywhere (e.g. in your profile page)
- The *markdown* symbol copies the same link in Markdown format, so you can use it in your solutions
